TODO FILE:

:::IMPROVEMENTS/CLEANUP::::
-Make shaders into single file instead of split files(More maintainable and easier to read)
DONE - Keep improving it though
-consolidate down to 1 path in all resource files
DONE

-Extract winproc so we dont keep reapeating the same code in test projects and games that need to processes
winproc
DONE - Keep improving it though

-Make sure we are deleting all opengl data before we exit the main c++ function

-Need to create some functions in cmake so we can reuse some of the logic of setting up test projects
  -create_test_project() maybe?
DONE- Keep improving it though

::DEBUGGING:::
-Setup opengl error handling
DONE - Keep improving it though

:::TOOLS:::
-Get productivity power tools for Visual studio

-Lookup and start using Visual assist
DONE


-Get all cmakelist files updated so projects are doing debug and release linking and building(and x64 only)
DONE - Keep improving it though


::::PERFORMANCE:::::
-Need to check the codebase and try to use std::arrays anywhere possible instead of std::vector(This has really bad performance issues.
Consider everytime it grows it copies all its data to a new array)

-Need to try and store items in any array we're using as objects and not pointers, this will make sure the items are 
close together in memory and make accessing them alot faster

-Make sure we're using VAOs

-Make sure we're using index buffer to draw
